## Jarvis - Python Virtual Assistant
This is a basic voice-controlled virtual assistant built in Python named Jarvis. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to interact with the user, perform tasks like opening apps, playing favorite songs, fetching news, and answering questions using the OpenAI API.

## Setup Instructions
Before running the project, follow these steps:

- Create a virtual environment
- Activate the virtual environment
- On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

- On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

- Install the required modules:
you can manually install modules like speechrecognition, pyttsx3, openai, requests, etc., mentioned in the comments tags.

# How It Works
The core functionality is inside main.py. The assistant listens for the wake word "Jarvis". Once activated, it performs actions based on the voice commands, including:

- Opening desktop applications

- Reading top news headlines

- Playing music from a predefined favorites list

- Answering general knowledge questions using OpenAI

Each major logic section is commented within the code for clarity.

# Project Files
- main.py
The main driver of the virtual assistant. All core functionalities are coded and commented here.

- client.py
A standalone file to test if your OpenAI API key works properly. This file is not directly related to the main assistant logic.

- musiclibrary.py
Contains a Python dictionary of favorite songs which the assistant references when asked to play music.

# Notes
Make sure to add your own OpenAI API key (if required) and handle it securely. Avoid committing keys to public repositories.

Currently, the assistant uses basic command-based logic. You can extend it with more NLP features or GUI integrations.
